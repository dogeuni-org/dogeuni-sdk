```

## Using Dogecoin SDK

```typescript
import { DogeWallet } from "@unielon/coin-dogecoin";
let wallet = new DogeWallet()
let privateKey = "QRJx7uvj55L3oVRADWJfFjJ31H9Beg75xZ2GcmR8rKFNHA4ZacKJ"
const commitTxPrevOutputList: PrevOutput[] = [];
commitTxPrevOutputList.push({
    txId: "3cb1d8da082b2146b8f4c09b06e38eb37f0263ecefb8a52600accc75ccef4c90",
    vOut: 1,
    amount: 793850000,
    address: "DJu5mMUKprfnyBhot2fqCsW9sZCsfdfcrZ",
    privateKey: privateKey,
});
const inscriptionDataList: DrcInscriptionData[] = [];
inscriptionDataList.push({
  contentType: 'text/plain;charset=utf-8',
  body: `{"p":"drc-20","op":"deploy","tick": "GOODS" ,"max": "210000000000", "lim": "1000000"}`,
  revealAddr: 'DJu5mMUKprfnyBhot2fqCsW9sZCsfdfcrZ',
  repeat: repeat || 1
});
const request = {
  commitTxPrevOutputList,
  commitFeeRate: 50000,
  revealFeeRate: 50000,
  inscriptionDataList,
  changeAddress: 'DJu5mMUKprfnyBhot2fqCsW9sZCsfdfcrZ',
};
const res =  await wallet.inscribeDrc(dogeCoin, request)
```
### Deploy drc-20

Inscribe the deploy function to you ordinal compatible wallet with the desired drc-20 parameters set.
It's a example of deploy script as following:
```typescript
{ 
  "p": "drc-20",
  "op": "deploy",
  "tick": "wow",
  "max": "1000000",
  "lim": "100"
}
```

command parameter description
| Key  | Require | Description                                      |
|------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| p    | yes     | Protocol: Helps other systems identify and process drc-20 events  |
| op   | yes     | Operation: Type of event (Deploy, Mint, Transfer)                 |
| tick | yes     | Ticker: letter identifier of the drc-20, equal to 3 or 4 characters |
| max  | yes     | Max supply: set max supply of the drc-20                               |
| lim  | no      | Mint limit: If letting users mint to themsleves, limit per cardinal  |

### Mint drc-20

Inscribe the mint function to your cardinal compatible wallet. Make sure the ticker matches either a) the drc-20 you deployed in step 1, or b) any drc-20 that has yet to reach its fully diluted supply. Also if the drc-20 has a mint limit, make sure not to surpass this.

It's a example of mint script as following:
```typescript
{ 
  "p": "drc-20",
  "op": "mint",
  "tick": "wow",

WDOGE is a special kind of drc20. Its mint volume depends entirely on the userâ€™s pledge amount. User can receive wdoge when he/she deposit dogecoin .
The amount he/she withdraw is same with he/she deposit. Hence there are two operator of wdoge: withdraw and deposit.

  "amt": "100"
}
```

```typescript
{ 
  "p": "wdoge",
  "op": "withdraw",

  "amt": "100"
}
```

###  Add or remove the liquidity of pairs
The user can add or remove the liquidity of pairs, and the liquidity of pairs provide the price.
